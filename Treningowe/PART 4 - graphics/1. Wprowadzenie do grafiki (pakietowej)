# GRAPHICS
# few different package, for example: lattice, ggplot2, graphics, rCharts

# the same type of graph has a different view in different package
# for example - scatterplot
library('PBImisc')
# datasource kidney

# 1 standard scatterplot in car package
library(car)
sp(MDRD12 ~ MDRD7, data = kidney)
# as we can see, by default smooth and regLine is set on TRUE, so on the chart are regression line and smooth regressions line (?)
# what's the method of calculation the smooth line?
sp(MDRD12 ~ MDRD7, data = kidney, smooth = F)
# ellipse shows data-consentration elipses
# what's the method of calulation the ellipse line?
sp(MDRD12 ~ MDRD7, data = kidney, regLine = F, smooth = F, ellipse = T)
# grid - siatka w tle
sp(MDRD12 ~ MDRD7, data = kidney, regLine = F, smooth = F, grid = T)


# just scatter plot without additives:
sp(MDRD12 ~ MDRD7, data = kidney, regLine = F, smooth = F, boxplots = F)
